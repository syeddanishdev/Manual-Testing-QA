Manual Testing Best Practices

Clear Naming: Use prefixes like "TC001_Login_Valid" for test cases.
Modular Test Cases: Limit test cases to one objective for clarity.
Risk-Based Testing: Prioritize high-risk areas (see risk-assessment.md).
Test Coverage: Ensure traceability to requirements (see test-coverage.md).
Bug Reporting: Log detailed bugs in Jira with steps, screenshots, and logs (see bug-tracking.md).
Stakeholder Communication: Share clear, concise reports with actionable insights.
Environment Consistency: Test across browsers/devices to ensure compatibility.
