Test Coverage Strategy for Manual Testing
Test coverage ensures all critical functionalities are tested, reducing production defects.
Coverage Approach

Requirement Mapping:
Map test cases to user stories or requirements using traceability matrices.
Example: Link "TC001_Login_ValidCredentials" to "US-101: User Login."


Coverage Types:
Functional: Test all user flows (e.g., login, payment).
Negative: Test error conditions (e.g., invalid credentials).
Edge Cases: Test boundaries (e.g., max cart items).
Security: Test vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS in login).


Coverage Metrics:
Requirement Coverage: Ensure 100% of critical requirements are tested.
Configuration Coverage: Test across browsers/devices (Chrome, Firefox, iOS).
Scenario Coverage: Cover positive, negative, and edge cases.


Implementation:
Use spreadsheets or tools to track test cases vs. requirements.
Example: Create a matrix mapping "US-201: Payment" to TC004-TC007.
Review coverage gaps before release.



Example
For an e-commerce app:

Login Module:
Requirements: US-101 (Login), US-102 (Password Reset).
Test Cases: TC001-TC003 (100% requirement coverage).
Configurations: Chrome, Firefox (100% browser coverage).


Payment Module:
Requirements: US-201 (Credit Card), US-202 (PayPal).
Test Cases: TC004-TC007 (100% critical flows, 80% edge cases).
