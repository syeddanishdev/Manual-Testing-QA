Manual Testing Roadmap for QA Teams
This roadmap outlines setting up a manual testing framework for an e-commerce application, integrating risk assessment, test coverage, and Jira bug tracking/reporting.
Step 1: Define Testing Objectives

Objective: Ensure high-quality user experience through comprehensive manual testing.
Action: Identify testing scope (e.g., functional, negative, edge cases) and align with Agile/DevOps.
Example: For an e-commerce app, test "Login," "Payment," and "Checkout" modules.

Step 2: Create a Test Plan

Action: Develop a test plan (see templates/test-plan-template.md).
Components: Scope, resources, schedule, test types, and deliverables.
Example: Plan to test checkout across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

Step 3: Perform Risk Assessment

Action: Prioritize test cases using a risk matrix (see risk-assessment.md).
Example: Focus on payment failures (high impact, high likelihood).

Step 4: Design Test Cases

Action: Create detailed test cases for functional, negative, edge, and security scenarios (see test-cases/).
Example: Test login with invalid credentials or maximum cart items.
Tip: Use test-case-template.md for consistency.

Step 5: Ensure Test Coverage

Action: Map test cases to requirements to achieve comprehensive coverage (see test-coverage.md).
Example: Ensure 100% coverage of critical payment flows.

Step 6: Execute Tests

Action: Assign test cases to testers, execute across environments, and log results.
Example: Test checkout on multiple browsers and document outcomes.

Step 7: Track and Report Bugs in Jira

Action: Log defects in Jira with detailed steps and track resolution (see bug-tracking.md).
Example: Report a payment failure bug with screenshots and logs.

Step 8: Generate Reports

Action: Create reports for stakeholders (e.g., test coverage, defect trends) in Jira.
Example: Export a defect trend report to share with PMs.
